# Lego Markup

This is a quick and dirty program to markup the pdf at `instructions.pdf` with colors and color numbers determined by the `color_values` dictionary.
The program will output `instructions_markup.pdf` and `color_swatches.pdf`.

You'll need a few python packages: `pip install matplotlib numpy Image PyMuPDF`
